# Spark Streaming

## Instructions

There are two labs for this lesson. In the first lab, we'll look at a stream of transactions and look for suspicious transactions. The second lab will illustrate the windowing feature of Spark Streams.

Stream processors typically run as daemons in the real world, so we decided for the Scala and Java guys to use more traditional methods than the notebooks to build and deploy these projects.

We'll also illustrate that you can do streaming through notebooks as well for the Python developers.

## Accessing Lab Descriptions

* Lab 01: Suspicious Purchase Amount
  * Scala (you can use both notebooks or build on a daemon)
    * To build a daemon use these instructions:  [lesson-550-spark-streaming/labs/lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts/scala/instructions.md](lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts/scala/instructions.md)
    * To use notebooks look here: [lesson-550-spark-streaming/labs/lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts/notebooks/scala-550-lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts.ipynb](lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts/notebooks/scala-550-lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts.ipynb)

  * Python
    * We'll use notebooks
      * The notebook is here:
      [lesson-550-spark-streaming/labs/lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts/notebooks/python-550-lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts-window-operations.ipynb](lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts/notebooks/python-550-lab-01-suspicious-purchase-amounts-window-operations.ipynb)

## Solutions

The solutions (which includes the Java code), can be found in the directory `lesson-550-spark-streaming/solutions`.
