Well, that's true, but we're going to pull a dirty little mapping trick here, and transform the `DStream[Tx]` to a `Stream[(K, V)]`.  `V` will certainly be `Tx`, but what will `K` be?  Well, since we're only doing it so that we can easily sum up all of the `Tx`s in each batch, we can just use a constant.  Any constant value will do fine, since we're not really using it:  `1`, `0`, or even `\"Bob\"` will work.  Let's just use Scala's `None`, since it conveys nicely that we're not really using the key except to group *all* of the transactions together.\n",

With that, let's define our state update function now.\n",

Just so you're not left on the edge of your seat, let me disappoint you now by telling you that we're going to do something pretty simple:  we'll see if any transactions are within a given tolerance of the average of all transactions seen in each window.  While that's our (boring) algorithm, we're going to have to first see how we can combine our state with incoming transactions using our average-comparing fraud detection function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not surprisingly, we need to use `states`, a `DStream`, along with the transaction stream.  We could use `windowTxs`, but that uses `Tuple`s with a key of `None`, which is just a waste of time, considering that we still have our original stream, so we transform it via `map(_._2)` to get just the transaction data from it before combining.  The `DStream` method that we're interested in here is called `transformWith`.  It takes a different `DStream` and a function, and returns a new `DStream` that represents the result of transforming `this` stream (our `State`), and the other stream (the `Tx`s),  with the given function, fraud detection.\n"

    "``` scala\n",

Then, as a convenience, we map the suspicious `Tx`s so that we return a `Tuple` of the percentage the amount is out of whack & the `Tx` itself; this makes `V` in the function signature above be `(String,Tx)`.
