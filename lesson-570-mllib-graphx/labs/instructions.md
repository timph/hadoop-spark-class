# MLib and GraphX

## Instructions

We have two labs for this lesson. In the first lab we'll look at one of the machine learning algorithms (k-mean). In the second lab we'll explore the graph API.


## Structure of this lab

These labs run in notebooks (although, a spark-shell version can also be found under the instructions).

Python programmers should use the Scala version of the notebooks for the graph exploration. The reason being that PySpark doesn't support GraphX (yet).
