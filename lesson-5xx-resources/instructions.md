# Spark Installation


For our labs, we will use Spark 1.5.2. An easy way to start with Spark is to use a binary distribution with Hadoop libraries.



You can download our version `spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz` from [here](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/spark/spark-1.5.2/spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz).

> For a future reference, Spark [download page](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)  offers various versions.

## Steps

1. Expand the `tgz` file in a directory of your choice. This will create a directory with the name `spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.6`. We will  refer to this directory as "Spark home".

That's it!

You will start using Spark in the next labs.


# Data for the Labs

This directory already contains some smaller files for the labs.

We wanted to prevent adding large data files to the GitHub, so we placed a zipped version of the larger files into DropBox.

You can download the zip file from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vis2e6f8wayvhvv/AAD1WAhYtos1Is7v-4tYkBJFa?dl=1).

Unzip it. You will see two files:
- byu-corpus.txt (91 MB)
- sherlock-holmes.txt (6.4 MB)
