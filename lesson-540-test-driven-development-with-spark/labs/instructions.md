# Test Driven Development in Spark

## Instructions

In this lab we take a look at how to use TDD for Spark using Spark and the test driven tools of Spark.

This is an optional lab.

## Structure of this lab

This lab does not run on Notebooks. Instead, we have a simple SBT chapter to illustrate how test driven development may be used with Spark.

The lab instructions for Scala and TDD can be found here:

* Lab 01: TDD with Spark Word Count
  * Scala
    * [lesson-540-test-driven-development-with-spark/labs/lab-01-tdd-with-spark-word-count/instructions.md](lab-01-tdd-with-spark-word-count/instructions.md)

## Solutions

The solutions (which includes the Java code), can be found in the directory `lesson-540-test-driven-development-with-spark/solutions`.
