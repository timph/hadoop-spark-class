# Hello World in Spark

## Introduction

This is a lab only section. We will make sure that:

1. You have everything installed that you need for the class
2. That you get to try out the various ways that you can run our exercises.
  * Using the Spark Shell
  * Using the Notebooks
3. That you pick a language or a strategy for running the exercises through the class

## Instructions

### Install Spark

If you have not yet done so, let's start by installing Spark.

You can find the instructions for how to install Spark here:

[lab-01/installation_spark.md](lab-01/installation_spark.md)

When you have finished to install Spark, come back to this file and continue below.

### Running Spark Shell

Here is the instructions for the first part of the lab. Running a Spark Job inside a Spark Shell.

[lab-01/running-spark-shell.md](lab-01/running-spark-shell.md).

When you finish with this exercise, we'll try out the note books.

### Running a Notebook

In this lab we'll run a notebook and illustrate how a notebook works.

Please continue with [this lab](lab-01/running-notebooks.md) and when you're done, you're ready for the next section.

### Importing the Hello World

Let's try out some Spark code also in a Jupyter Notebook.
Since we used Scala when we ran the Spark Shell, let's use the notebooks to run a Python-based example.

After you've seen how to run a Notebook, you should be ready to make your selection for how to run the labs in this course.

We have a hello world for python and spark. You'll need to upload the labs into the work directory of you Jupyter environment. Please import and run the file `lesson-510-hello-spark/labs/lab-01/python-510-hello.ipynb`. Using the same procedure as for the hello-world notebook.

After you've imported and opened this file, all the instructions are in the notebooks itself.

## Conclusion and Discussion

You should now be able to pick a path for the course. We suggest you picke one of the following options:

1. Run the Jupyter Notebooks using Python
2. Run the Jupyter Notebooks using Scala
3. Run the Spark Shell with Scala
4. (Hard, but possible) Write the code in your favorite IDE using Java or Scala
